1181,"Contract Solutions was founded by a team of specialist Project Managers and Quantity Surveyors, consistently frustrated by the poor offering from traditional Groundwork & Civil Engineering Contractors. The Management Team represented several large regional Contractors & Developers and consistently found the Groundwork packages too slow, too expensive and worst of all - adversarial. Traditional Groundwork Contractors did not have the knowledge or commercial skill-set to incentivize site teams with well-policed price work. Instead, they would flood the project with unmotivated men on simple hourly rates. As a result, programmes would inevitably slip, and their costs would spiral. Not understanding, or not able, to fully implement downstream price work led to Contractors reverting to type to recover their positions; pushing blame on to the Developer with ridiculous 'extras', pointing fingers and tearing up contracts. The team at CONTRACT SOLUTIONS decided to build their own Groundworks team for Developers and Contractors they represented based upon core value of excellent internal cost control through well-policed price work .The results were outstanding And so CONTRACT SOLUTIONS brand methods were expanded external Clients","[43, 44, 45, 47, 48, 87]"
